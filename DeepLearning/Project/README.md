Implementing an image classification application: 

This project train a deep learning model on a data set of images (oxford flower 102- https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/). 
Then use the trained model to classify images.

1. develop the code in a Jupyter notebook to make sure your training implementation works. 
2. convert the code to a Python application. There are two options:
  2.1. load a previous model and then use the trained model to classify images
  2.2  train a deep learning model and then use the trained model to classify images.
